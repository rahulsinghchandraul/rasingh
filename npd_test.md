**Grandiosity**:The person tends to see herself as a sort of superwoman, with unreasonable expectations for her success, performance, wealth, and the like. She feels she must win all of the time and that she knows what’s best for others.

**Entitlement attitude**: This attitude is one that assumes that everyone is just an extension of her self and therefore others are under her control and just exist to meet her needs, even unspoken ones. Others are not recognized as separate and distinct individuals. She expects and demands preferential treatment and feels that her needs should receive priority over the needs of others.

**Lack of empathy**: She is indifferent to the impact of her critical, demeaning, and devaluing comments and remarks but simultaneously expects others to be empathic to her. She constantly blames others for mistakes and what cannot be changed.

**Extensions of self**: Since the person does not recognize others as separate from her, she expects favors but does not return them. She gives orders and expects these to be promptly carried out, and expects others to read her mind and know what she wants without having to speak. She asks intrusive personal questions and tells others what they should or ought to do, but she doesn’t respect others’ property or boundaries.

**Impoverished self**: The behaviors that signal the impoverished self includes constantly decrying how she is deprived, left out, and minimized, even when there is no evidence to support this perspective. She can be self-depreciating but will become angry or hurt if others agree. She uses put-downs of herself in an effort to get others to disagree.

**Attention seeking**: Most of these behaviors and attitudes are easily seen as the person usually or always does some or all of them. She not only speaks loudly, she talks a lot. She enters and exits rooms noisily, dresses to attract attention, and makes grand gestures.

**Admiration seeking**: These behaviors are those that are constantly done for public approval and approbation, which the subject craves as external signs of worthiness, superiority, and the like. She boasts and brags about accomplishments and promotes herself for awards and other recognitions. She responds to flattery but does not recognize insincere compliments.

**Shallow emotions**: This person expresses and experiences few emotions, usually only anger and fear. She has the words for feelings, but these are empty.

**Envious**: This person displays envy when she says and does things that reflect resentment of others’ success, accomplishments, possessions, or opportunities, and feels that she is more deserving. Feelings of envy can trigger the impoverished self.

**Contemptuous**: Contempt is a part of feeling superior, where the person thinks that others are less deserving, worthwhile, or valuable. She will make negative and demeaning comments about others’ value and worth, such as poor people not deserving assistance.

**Arrogant**: This attitude of feeling vastly superior to others can be seen in behaviors such as talking down or patronizingly to others. She is not shy about letting others know that she perceives them as inferior and makes frequent references to her superiority.

**Empty at the core of self**: The empty person perceives relationships as existing for her convenience and hops from relationship to relationship, never able to make real connections. She is unable to form and maintain meaningful, satisfying, and enduring relationships, becomes very anxious when alone, and seems to crave or need activity.

**Reverses subjecting and nurturing**: The victim is made responsible for the subject’s well-being instead of the usual reverse expectation. Behaviors that signal this attitude include statements like the following: “If you loved me, you would…”; “I love you when you…”; “Don’t you want me to love you?”; “You make me feel good when you…”; “I don’t like it when you disappoint me”; “Can’t you ever do what I want or need you to do?”

**Basks in the victim’s reflected glory**: This subject demands that the victim become and do what she desires, for example, by excelling in athletics and school achievement or displaying other talents. The victim must be very successful or the subject will be displeased. She is indifferent to or ignores the victim’s desires. Intolerant of victim’s values, needs, and so on: She cannot perceive the victim as a separate and distinct individual but only as an extension of her. She cannot tolerate disagreement or any hint of criticism, as she should always be perceived as perfect, and blames the victim for perceived imperfections and mistakes.

**Exploits others**: This behavior and attitude are also reflections of an inability to perceive and relate to others as separate, different, and worthwhile individuals. Others are perceived as existing for her benefit and subject to exploitive behaviors, such as taking unfair advantage of others, manipulating others to get her own way, and assuming unearned credit.
