# College was fun

## I led the tech. club, hosted gaming tournaments and played pranks on April Fools

For two years, I led the tech club, and via the computer networks squad, kept the internet running. I was liable for responsible gaming as Gaming coordinator. Chosen as a core organizer of our cultural fest, I was responsible for manifold duties, apart from hosting Al-Khwarizm in 2011, a famous programming contest. But by far, my favourite times were discussing philosophy with Dr. Verma. He introduced me to various thinkers and their wisdom. Our discussions convinced me to diversify my interests and try them out. And that is what I did.
