# I led the VR team at Housing

## We made the first scalable real estate VR product in India

Led by some of the smartest people in the tech space, Housing fostered a culture of open thought, and encouraged new ideas, while serving a million users a month. A prototype VR app I made led the way to setting up a team to develop a product. With a rigorous process of researching and user testing every feature, we completed a VR experience in three months. It was a success. To optimize the build time, we set up an automated build process with a single point of intervention, bringing down creation times from a magnitude of weeks to hours. New ideas and the freedom to experiment reinforced that research is my calling.
