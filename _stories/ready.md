# Let's make some impact

## For I'm locked and loaded

In my two years at Georgia Tech, I've worked with leaders in Mixed reality, Deep Learning, and Ubiquitous Computing. The depth of their knowledge and keen critical thinking has evolved my perspective towards technology. No longer just a problem solver, I believe systems that support all the stakeholders involved live longer, and have lasting impact. These systems have greatly enhanced my own life. But seeing the effectiveness that my mentors' systems have allowed them to have in the world, I'm ready to blaze forward and build technologies that improve people's lives!
