# I believe in the future

## And in its technology

I’ve got my AR goggles on, my AI speaking in my ear, while I’m waiting in my electric self-driving car for the Hyperloop train to arrive with a ticket bought using cryptocurrency. I believe that technology is inherently neutral, and in moderation, new developments help us live a fuller life. Mixed reality provides the canvas through which these new technologies can help paint a beautiful tomorrow, and I want to help guide the creation of this canvas.
