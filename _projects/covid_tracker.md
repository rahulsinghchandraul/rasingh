# 3D US COVID-19 Tracker

## Why?

In the first quarter of 2020, COVID-19 became a major pandemic. This affected everyone's routines around the globe, and we decided to use the opportunity to explore an interface to navigate through this hierarchical data in VR. The US presents a strict geographical hierarchy, and COVID-19 provides a time axis which will help the user with navigation. Combining both these data axes, we came up with an interface which lets the user freely work with this data in VR.

Due to a lack of time, we couldn't implement all the planned features for the interface. A demo and a video explaining the project can be found below. A complete report on this project is also posted below.
